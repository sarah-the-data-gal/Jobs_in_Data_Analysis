Introduction
This repository contains an analysis of a Kaggle dataset focusing on various jobs and salaries in the data science field. The dataset includes information about job titles, job categories, salaries, employment type, and work settings. The analysis aims to provide insights into different career opportunities in data science, salary expectations across different roles and categories, and trends within the industry.
Data Cleaning Process
To ensure the data was suitable for analysis, several data cleaning processes were implemented:

Geographical Focus: Data was restricted to the United States, removing all European countries from the Employee Residence column.

Column Removal: The "Salary In USD" column was dropped as it was deemed unnecessary for the analysis.

These cleaning steps resulted in a more focused dataset, reducing the initial 9,355 jobs to 6,644 jobs for analysis.
